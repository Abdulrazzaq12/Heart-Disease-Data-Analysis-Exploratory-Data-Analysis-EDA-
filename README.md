# Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-
📌 Project Overview:

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Understanding the key risk factors can help in early detection and prevention. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a heart disease dataset to analyze patterns, correlations, and distributions of health indicators like cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and heart rate.

📊 Dataset:

Source: Kaggle - Heart Disease Data
Records: 303 patients
Features: 14 attributes including age, gender, cholesterol, blood pressure, and a target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.

🔍 Key Objectives:

✔️ Check dataset structure and missing values

✔️ Analyze heart disease distribution

✔️ Examine demographics (age & gender distribution)

✔️ Compute mean/median of key health metrics (cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate)

✔️ Visualize insights using Matplotlib & Seaborn

✔️ Detect outliers in cholesterol & blood pressure

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
📜 Code Implementation

The EDA script includes:

General Information – Dataset shape & missing values

Target Variable Analysis – Heart disease presence distribution

Demographic Insights – Age and gender analysis

Health Metrics – Blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate stats

Categorical Feature Analysis – Chest pain type & exercise-induced angina

Visualizations – Age distribution, cholesterol comparison, outlier detection

📷 Visualizations:

Some of the visual insights include:
📌 Age Distribution Histogram

📌 Cholesterol Levels for Patients With & Without Heart Disease

📌 Outlier Detection in Cholesterol & Blood Pressure
